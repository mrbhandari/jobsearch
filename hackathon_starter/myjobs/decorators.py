def requires(*activities, **callbacks):
    """
    Protects a view by activity and app access, optionally invoking callbacks.

    This decorator determines from the list of passed in :activities: what app
    access is needed to continue processing the decorated view. If the user
    belongs to a company who doesn't have the right app access, a
    `MissingAppAccess` response is returned. If the company has the right app
    access but the user's roles don't include the enumerated activities, a
    `MissingActivity` response is returned instead. If both activities and app
    access constraints are met, the decorated view is processed as normal.

    `MissingAppAccess` and `MissingActivity` are simply aliases for
    `HttpResponseForbidden'. They are made distinct so that in testing the
    reason for a 403 response is clearer, without actually having to leak
    information back to the user.

    Inputs:
    :activities: A list of activity names that the decorated view should
                   check against.
    :callbacks: callbacks['activity_callback'] is a callable to be used as a
                view response when the use isn't associated with the correct
                subset of activities. callbacks['access_callback'] is a
                callable to be used as a view response when the users's company
                doesn't have the appropriate app access (as determined by the
                passed in activities).

                Both callbacks take a `request` parameter which can be used to
                do further processing before returning an alternate result.

    Examples:
    Let's assume that the activities "create user", "read user", "update user",
    and "delete user" exist with an app access of "User Management". Let us
    further assume that a `modify_user` view exists. Finally, lets assume that
    the current user belongs to a company, `TestCompany`.

    We might want to decorate that view as follows:

        @requires("read user", "update user")
        def modify_user(request):
            ...

    If `TestCompany` doesn't have access to "User Management", then attempting
    to navigate to `modify_user` would result in a `MissingAppAccess` response.
    If that company does have "User Management" access, but the user's roles
    don't include both the "read user" and "update user" activities, a
    `MissingActivity` response would returned instead. If both conditions are
    met, the `modify_user` view will proceed as though it weren't decorated at
    all.

    If a `MissingActivity` response is insufficient (because you want to give
    the user some useful information) you may additionally pass an
    `activity_callback`, which will return the appropriate response:

        def callback(request):
            return HttpResponse("<strong>Insufficient permissions. "
                                "Please contact your administrator</strong>")

        @requires("read user", "update user", activity_callback=callback)
        def modify_user(request):
            ...

    In this case, the user will see the appropriate message in bold, with a
    status code of 200. A similar strategy can be used for customizing the
    response used when app access is missing by passing `access_callback`.
